# MSync-2

Why version 2?

Let's be honest here, version one is a broken piece of shit. It errors out everywhere, the GUI does not work and when you remove it, all bans and stuff are lost, because we overwrite the origiinal commands.

It was my first addon I ever made, and now looking back with my new knowledge, I feel ashamed for the code.

Version 2 will include a lot of changes, like:
- New Database Structure
- Completly own GUI System (Means we use GMod ressources and not XGUI anymore, because XGUI is shit)
- Module system, to easily extend features
- STEAK


# A Note to the different versions

MSync 2 is Split up in 3 versions:
- EGG
- CHEESE
- STEAK

EGG is the WIP addon which does not work yet at all. DO NOT USE ANYTHING OF THIS! The file structure will change propably. If you have problems with a EGG version, we do not Provide support. Use the STEAK version or at least CHEESE.

CHEESE is the beta phase of the addon. The addon works, but has propably bugs everywhere that needs to be found yet. If you have errors whith this version, please inform us with a GitHub issue or over our ticketsystem: [https://www.Aperture-Development.de/ticketsystem](https://www.Aperture-Development.de/ticketsystem)

STEAK is the stable version of MSync 2. This version is safe to be used on your server.

Why do all versions are named after food?

Because it's a joke, as you maybe know, Debian distributions are named after the characters of Toy Story, and I thought its funny to have something like that for our Addons.

# A note to modules

If you plan on extending the features of MSync 2, please copy and use the samplemodule files. You can distribute the Module under every licence you like. We always use the root_dir/LICENCE which is basicly the Licence you get the addon with. If you download it from GitHub or Steam it will most likely be under the by-nc-sa 4.0 licence, while when you download it over our website, you will get the Aperture Development Commercial licence.
